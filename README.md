## 🚀 How to Play
1. Two players take turns rolling the dice.  
2. On each roll:  
   - If the dice rolls `1`, the player's turn ends, and their **current score** is reset to `0`.  
   - If the dice rolls `2-6`, the number is added to their **current score**.  
3. Players can choose to **"Hold"** their current score, adding it to their **total score**, and pass the turn to the other player.  
4. The first player to reach the target score (default: 100) wins the game!
